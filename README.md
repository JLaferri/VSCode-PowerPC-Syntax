# VSCode PowerPC Syntax Highlighting

Language support for POWER/ppc/powerpc assembly in VSCode.   
This is a port from the Atom Extension: https://github.com/ruscur/language-powerpc-assembly

## Notes
If you use the VSCode Atom Theme it will look exactly like it does in Atom  

Heavily borrows from [language-x86](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/language-x86) by [taylorlapeyre](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/).

Instructions are taken from what's in binutils.
